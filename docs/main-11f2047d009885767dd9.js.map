Wraps a single child without adding\n\tadditional DOM nodes.\n\t\n\tThe API attempts to be as declarative as possible. A single animation property declares what\n\tanimation the child should have. If that property changes, this component applies the new animation\n\tto the child on the next tick.\n\t\n\tBy default, the animation is not run when the component is mounted. Instead, Velocity's \"finish\"\n\tcommand is used to jump to the animation's end state. For a component that animates out of and\n\tback in to a default state, this allows the parent to specify the \"animate into\" animation as\n\tthe default, and therefore not have to distinguish between the initial state and the state to\n\treturn to after animating away.\n\t\n\tProperties:\n\t animation: Either an animation key or hash defining the animation. See Velocity's documentation\n\t   for what this can be. (It is passed to Velocity exactly.)\n\t runOnMount: If true, runs the animation even when the component is first mounted.\n\t targetQuerySelector: By default, this component's single child is animated. If targetQuerySelector\n\t   is provided, it is used to select descendants to apply the animation to. Use with caution, only\n\t   when you're confident that React's reconciliation will preserve these nodes during animation.\n\t   Also note querySelectorAll's silly behavior w.r.t. pruning results when being called on a node.\n\t   A special value of \"children\" will use the direct children of the node, since there isn't a\n\t   great way to specify that to querySelectorAll.\n\t interruptBehavior: Sets how the previous animation should behave when the \"animation\" prop is\n\t   changed before it’s done. Default is \"stop\", which halts the animation where it is. \"finish\"\n\t   will jump the animation to its completed appearance. \"queue\" will run the new animation after\n\t   the previous one has finished.\n\t\n\tUnrecognized properties are passed as options to Velocity (e.g. \"duration\", \"delay\", \"loop\").\n\t\n\tMethods:\n\t runAnimation: Triggers the animation immediately. Useful for when you want an animation that\n\t   corresponds to an event but not a particular model state change (e.g. a \"bump\" when a click\n\t   occurs).\n\t*/\n\t\n\tvar _ = {\n\t  forEach: __webpack_require__(15),\n\t  isEqual: __webpack_require__(41),\n\t  keys: __webpack_require__(23),\n\t  omit: __webpack_require__(49)\n\t};\n\tvar React = __webpack_require__(1);\n\tvar ReactDOM = __webpack_require__(64);\n\tvar Velocity = __webpack_require__(65);\n\t\n\tvar VelocityComponent = React.createClass({\n\t  displayName: 'VelocityComponent',\n\t\n\t  propTypes: {\n\t    animation: React.PropTypes.any,\n\t    children: React.PropTypes.element.isRequired,\n\t    runOnMount: React.PropTypes.bool,\n\t    targetQuerySelector: React.PropTypes.string,\n\t    interruptBehavior: React.PropTypes.string\n\t    // Any additional properties will be sent as options to Velocity\n\t  },\n\t\n\t  getDefaultProps: function () {\n\t    return {\n\t      animation: null,\n\t      runOnMount: false,\n\t      targetQuerySelector: null,\n\t      interruptBehavior: 'stop'\n\t    }\n\t  },\n\t\n\t  componentDidMount: function () {\n\t    this.runAnimation();\n\t\n\t    // Jump to the end so that the component has the visual appearance of the animation having\n\t    // been run to completion.\n\t    if (this.props.runOnMount !== true) {\n\t      this._finishAnimation();\n\t    }\n\t  },\n\t\n\t  componentWillUpdate: function (newProps, newState) {\n\t    if (!_.isEqual(newProps.animation, this.props.animation)) {\n\t      if (newProps.interruptBehavior === 'stop') {\n\t        this._stopAnimation();\n\t      } else if (newProps.interruptBehavior === 'finish') {\n\t        this._finishAnimation();\n\t      }\n\t\n\t      this._scheduleAnimation();\n\t    }\n\t  },\n\t\n\t  componentWillUnmount: function () {\n\t    this._stopAnimation();\n\t    this._clearVelocityCache(this._getDOMTarget());\n\t  },\n\t\n\t  // It's ok to call this externally!

Use this for non-animating properties (like \"position\") that\n\tare prerequisites for correct animation. The style value is applied using Velocity's JS -> CSS\n\troutines, which may differ from React's.\n\t\n\tAny hash entries beyond \"animation\" and \"style\" are passed in an options hash to Velocity. Use this\n\tfor options like \"stagger\", \"reverse\", &tc.\n\t\n\tBy default, this component will immediately hide all entering children with display: 'none', and\n\tunhide them one tick later with display: ''. This is done so that we can coalesce multiple enters\n\tinto a single animation, and we want to avoid any popping of elements in while they're collected. If\n\tyou prefer a different way of hiding these elements so that e.g. geometry can be immediately\n\tcalculated, use the enterHideStyle and enterShowStyle props to provide alternate style hashes for\n\thiding and revealing entering elements.\n\t\n\tStatics\n\t  disabledForTest: Set this to true globally to turn off all custom animation logic.

<li>effects：一般异步的操作（有副作用的操作，非纯函数）放在 effects，而不放在 reducers 中。对于业务来说，大部分操作都是异步请求，因此 effects 更经常使用。另外，effects 无须返回 state，通常我们会把异步操作返回，也就是返回一个 promise。除此之外，effects 看起来和 reducers 并没有什么两样，定义的方法同样会挂载到

<p>这样看起来和 connect 似乎并无差别，重点是 mapDispatchToProps 可以直接取到 this.props 的值作为参数，来看下 mapDispatchToProps 的使用：</p> <pre><code class=\\\"hljs javascript\\\"><span class=hljs-keyword>import</span> { actions } <span class=hljs-keyword>from</span> <span class=hljs-string>'cat-eye'</span>\\n<span class=hljs-comment>// mapDispatchToProps 的 props 即这个组件的 this.props</span>\\n<span class=hljs-keyword>export</span>

}\\n})(SomeComponent)\\n</code></pre> <p>而 mapStateToProps 和 connect 并无两异：</p> <pre><code>// mapStateToProps\\n(<span class=hljs-keyword>state</span>, ownProps) =&gt; {\\n  const s = <span class=hljs-keyword>state</span>.<span class=hljs-keyword>user</span>;\\n  return {\\n    // the fields you want <span class=hljs-keyword>to</span> map\\n  }\\n}\\n</code></pre><p>cat-eye 同样将 connect

<span class=hljs-string>'tom'</span>,\\n  age: <span class=hljs-number>20</span>\\n}\\n</code></pre> <p>setField 接受的 key-value 不支持多级，对于 state 是多层级的情况，可以这样处理：</p> <pre><code class=\\\"hljs

class=hljs-comment>// 将 jerry 修改</span>\\n  <span class=hljs-string>'job.title'</span>: <span class=hljs-string>'boss'</span>\\n}\\n</code></pre> <p>key-value 的 value 还可以是一个 function：</p> <pre><code>{\\n  <span class=hljs-attribute>age</span>: age =&gt; age + <span class=hljs-number>1</span>\\n}\\n</code></pre><h4 id=actions-setfield>actions 内置 setField</h4> <p>所有的 model，其 reducers 都会默认注册一个 setField 方法，这样 actions 上就会有该 model 的 setField 方法。正是由于这个方法的存在，导致了 reducers 存在感非常低，大部分设值操作都变得多余，直接通过 setField 进行即可。</p> <pre><code class=\\\"hljs javascript\\\">import { actions } <span class=hljs-keyword>from</span> 'cat-eye'\\n\\n// 在某个组件中直接修改 <span class=hljs-keyword>user</span> <span class=hljs-keyword>state</span>，无须定义 reducer\\nactions.<span class=hljs-keyword>user</span>.<span class=hljs-built_in>set</span>Field({\\n  name: 'tom',\\n  age: age =&gt; age + <span class=hljs-number>1</span>\\n})\\n</code></pre> <p>如果是纯粹的 redux 开发，这里要定义常量，定义 state，定义 action，实现 reducer，最后才在组件中进行 dispatch（可能还需要 connect），这里就简化成了一步。</p> <h4 id=-reducers->在 reducers 中使用</h4> <p><strong>重要：reducers 中定义的 function 请不要使用箭头函数，否则会丢失 this</strong></p> <p>reducers 的 function 是这样定义的：</p> <pre><code class=\\\"hljs javascript\\\">// <span class=hljs-keyword>user</span> model 的 reducers\\n\\n{\\n  // data 是 actions.<span class=hljs-keyword>user</span>.growUp(data) 传入的\\n  // getState 可以获取到 redux 的整个 <span class=hljs-keyword>state</span>\\n  growUp(data, getState) {\\n    // reducer 必须 return 一个新的 <span class=hljs-keyword>state</span>，<span class=hljs-built_in>set</span>Field 就有这个能力\\n    return this.<span class=hljs-built_in>set</span>Field({\\n      // ...\\n    })\\n  }\\n}\\n</code></pre> <p>可以看到，reducer 中的 this 具有 setField 方法，可以对自己的 model 的 state 进行更新。对于获取 state 的，分为：</p> <ul> <li>获取自己 model 的 state：通过 <code>this.getState()</code> 就可以拿到</li> <li>获取所有的 state：通过第二个参数 <code>getState()</code> 可以拿到，然后根据命名空间来获取，例如 getState().book.name</li> </ul> <h4 id=-effects->在 effects 中使用</h4> <p>effects 中的使用和 reducers 中完全一样，只是无须返回 state。同样，<strong>请不要使用箭头函数</strong>。一般在 effects 中会使用到 网络请求，这部分文档参看 <a href=#/docs/api/request>网络请求</a></p> <pre><code class=\\\"hljs

代理：同域方案，无兼容性问题，不暴露请求服务器，但需要服务端代码进行支持，前端工程中必须有服务端代码。还可以做合并请求、请求结果预处理等功能（这部分也需要服务端代码支持）</li> </ul> <h2 id=->配置与使用</h2> <p>请求配置文件位置：<code>config/proxy.js</code>，下面分 CORS、 server 代理、nginx 反向代理 三种情况来描述。</p> <p>先从 CORS 模式配置入手，并结合使用、本地开发模式。CORS 的基础知识可以参见：<a href=http://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2016/04/cors.html target=_blank>跨域资源共享 CORS 详解 - 阮一峰的网络日志</a>。</p> <h3 id=cors>CORS</h3> <p>假设存在一个 API，其支持 CORS 跨域请求 <code>config/proxy.js</code> 配置如下：</p> <pre><code class=\\\"hljs javascript\\\"><span class=hljs-keyword>const</span> <span class=hljs-built_in>config</span> = {\\n  api: {\\n    mode: <span class=hljs-string>'cors'</span>, <span class=hljs-comment>// CORS 模式</span>\\n    defaults: {\\n      <span class=hljs-comment>// 没有找到 env 时候的默认配置</span>\\n      url: <span class=hljs-string>'http://cors.me'</span>,\\n      prefix: <span class=hljs-string>'/v1.0'</span>\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n\\n<span class=hljs-keyword>module</span>.exports = <span class=hljs-built_in>config</span>\\n</code></pre> <p>上面声明了一个 api 的请求服务，mode 表明请求使用的模式是 cors。mode 可选值包括：</p> <ul> <li>cors：使用 CORS</li> <li>server：使用服务端代理，这是<em>默认值</em></li> <li>nginx：使用 nginx 反向代理</li> </ul> <p>defaults 是没有找到 env 时的默认使用的配置，其下字段含义为：</p> <ul> <li>url：CORS 请求的域</li> <li>prefix：每个请求的 url 的前缀部分</li> </ul> <p>如果想配置额外通用的参数，可以在这里配置，然后通过切面 before 的第三个参数 可以获取到进行统一的处理（before 的使用在本文的最后）。</p> <pre><code class=\\\"hljs javascript\\\"><span class=hljs-keyword>const</span> <span class=hljs-built_in>config</span> = {\\n  api: {\\n    mode: <span class=hljs-string>'cors'</span>, <span class=hljs-comment>// CORS 模式</span>\\n    defaults: {\\n      <span class=hljs-comment>// 没有找到 env 时候的默认配置</span>\\n      url: <span class=hljs-string>'http://cors.me'</span>,\\n      prefix: <span class=hljs-string>'/v1.0'</span>\\n    },\\n    params: {\\n      <span class=hljs-comment>// ...</span>\\n    },\\n    extra: {\\n      <span class=hljs-comment>// ...</span>\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n\\n<span class=hljs-keyword>module</span>.exports = <span class=hljs-built_in>config</span>\\n</code></pre> <p>业务中使用就非常的简单：</p> <pre><code class=\\\"hljs javascript\\\">import { request } <span class=hljs-keyword>from</span> <span class=hljs-string>'cat-eye'</span>\\n<span class=hljs-keyword>const</span> { api } = request\\n\\n<span class=hljs-comment>// 返回了一个 axios 对象（promise）</span>\\napi.<span class=hljs-keyword>get</span>(<span class=hljs-string>'/mock'</span>, {\\n  <span class=hljs-keyword>params</span>: {\\n    q: <span class=hljs-string>'hello'</span>\\n  }\\n})\\n</code></pre> <p>使用接口和 axios 相同，axios 文档可以查看：<a href=https://github.com/axios/axios#axios-api target=_blank>axios</a></p> <p>上面只声明了一个 defaults，则所有环境下都使用同一个请求配置，无论本地、测试环境、预生产环境，还是生产环境。不同环境下通常会有不同的请求配置，例如我们针对本地和测试环境，添加配置：</p> <pre><code class=\\\"hljs javascript\\\"><span class=hljs-keyword>const</span> <span class=hljs-built_in>config</span> = {\\n  api: {\\n    mode: <span class=hljs-string>'cors'</span>, <span class=hljs-comment>// CORS 模式</span>\\n    defaults: {\\n      <span class=hljs-comment>// 没有找到 env 时候的默认配置</span>\\n      url: <span class=hljs-string>'http://cors.me'</span>,\\n      prefix: <span class=hljs-string>'/v1.0'</span>\\n    },\\n    wds: {\\n      <span class=hljs-comment>// WDS 使用的配置</span>\\n      url: <span class=hljs-string>'http://local.cors.me'</span>,\\n      prefix: <span class=hljs-string>'/v1.0'</span>\\n    },\\n    debug: {\\n      url: <span class=hljs-string>'http://debug.cors.me'</span>,\\n      prefix: <span class=hljs-string>'/v1.0'</span>\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n\\n<span class=hljs-keyword>module</span>.exports = <span class=hljs-built_in>config</span>\\n</code></pre> <p>对于某个请求服务，使用到的配置优先级查找顺序是这样的：</p> <ol> <li>提供了 env，则根据 env 查找配置，找到则直接得到配置</li> <li>没有提供 env，或者提供的 env 对应的配置不存在，分情况来看：<ul> <li>如果通过 webpack-dev-server 来启动，则先找 key 为 wds 的配置（例如上面 api 请求服务，如果通过 WDS 启动，没有找到配置情况下会先查找 api.wds）；如果 wds 配置也不存在，才会去找 defaults 配置。</li> <li>对于非本地情况，不可能以 WDS 启动，因此没有找到配置情况下，默认都是查找 defaults 配置。</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>注意，本地如果配置了 wds，不论 mode 使用什么，都将使用 webpack-dev-server 的 proxy 代理，本质是 server 代理（wepack-dev-server 内置了 express 服务器）。webpack-dev-server 的文档可以点击查阅：<a href=https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html target=_blank>webpack dev server</a>，我们做了一层封装，让 webpack-dev-server 的 proxy 更简单使用。</p> <p>因此你通过 chrome 开发者工具看到的网络请求如下：</p> <pre><code>http:<span class=hljs-regexp>//</span>localhost:<span class=hljs-number>9000</span><span class=hljs-regexp>/api_wds/</span>v1.<span class=hljs-number>0</span><span class=hljs-regexp>/mock?q=hello</span>\\n</code></pre><p>是请求的本地 webpack-dev-server 服务器，api_wds 是脚手架自动添加的前缀用来给 webpack-dev-server 识别这是代理请求，需要转发。最终转发到</p> <pre><code>http:<span class=hljs-regexp>//</span>cors.me<span class=hljs-regexp>/v1.0/m</span>ock?q=hello\\n</code></pre><p>这个 URL 上。</p> <p>当然，本地如果配置了 wds，但是想测试下其他配置，可以使用 env 方式：</p> <pre><code class=\\\"hljs bash\\\"><span class=hljs-comment># 使用 defaults 配置</span>\\nnpm <span class=hljs-built_in>start</span> <span class=hljs-comment>--env=defaults</span>\\n\\n<span class=hljs-comment># 使用 debug 配置</span>\\nnpm <span class=hljs-built_in>start</span> <span class=hljs-comment>--env=debug</span>\\n</code></pre> <h3 id=server->server 代理</h3> <p>server 代理需要在前端工程中加入后端代码，因此项目不会是纯静态项目。后端代码通常是用来做统一请求处理，将请求统一转发到对应的服务器，从而绕过跨域限制。这个弊端就是对后端有要求，极端情况下，对接不同语言的后端，要分别实现一遍代理请求处理。</p> <p><code>config/proxy.js</code> 其配置和上面 CORS 基本一致：</p> <pre><code class=\\\"hljs javascript\\\"><span class=hljs-keyword>const</span> <span class=hljs-built_in>config</span> = {\\n  api: {\\n    mode: <span class=hljs-string>'server'</span>, <span class=hljs-comment>// server 模式，不填默认也是 server</span>\\n    defaults: {\\n      <span class=hljs-comment>// 没有找到 env 时候的默认配置</span>\\n      url: <span class=hljs-string>'http://cors.me'</span>,\\n      prefix: <span class=hljs-string>'/proxy/v1.0'</span>\\n    },\\n    wds: {\\n      <span class=hljs-comment>// WDS 使用的配置</span>\\n      url: <span class=hljs-string>'http://local.cors.me'</span>,\\n      prefix: <span class=hljs-string>'/v2.0'</span>\\n    },\\n    debug: {\\n      url: <span class=hljs-string>'http://debug.cors.me'</span>,\\n      prefix: <span class=hljs-string>'/proxy/v1.0'</span>\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n\\n<span class=hljs-keyword>module</span>.exports = <span class=hljs-built_in>config</span>\\n</code></pre> <p>和 CORS 中配置的区别是，非 wds 模式下，prefix 添加了一个前缀 /proxy（defaults 和 debug 配置中可以看到）。这个前缀是为了让后端代码路由识别，统一处理。这个规则需要前后端进行协定。</p> <p>wds 和上一节 CORS 中介绍的一致，业务代码使用请求也和 CORS 完全一致，不在赘述。</p> <h3 id=nginx->nginx 反向代理</h3> <p>nginx 反向代理和 server 代理类似，是实现了同域请求转发功能，只是转发功能放到了 nginx 上来处理。前端工程通常就需要 nginx 支持，因此和 server 代理对比，就没有了服务端代码。</p> <p><code>config/proxy.js</code> 其配置和上面 server 代理，除了 mode 外完全一致：</p> <pre><code class=\\\"hljs javascript\\\">const config = {\\n  api: {\\n    <span class=hljs-keyword>mode</span>: <span class=hljs-string>'nginx'</span>,\\n    default<span class=hljs-variable>s:</span> {\\n      // 没有找到 env 时候的默认配置\\n      ur<span class=hljs-variable>l:</span> <span class=hljs-string>'http://cors.me'</span>,\\n      prefix: <span class=hljs-string>'/proxy/v1.0'</span>\\n    },\\n    wd<span class=hljs-variable>s:</span> {\\n      // WDS 使用的配置\\n      ur<span class=hljs-variable>l:</span> <span class=hljs-string>'http://local.cors.me'</span>,\\n      prefix: <span

prefix: <span class=hljs-string>'/proxy/v1.0'</span>\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nmodule.exports = config\\n</code></pre> <p>prefix 在非 wds 配置下，同样增加了 /proxy 前缀，是为了发送请求后被 nginx 识别，将需要的请求转发到服务器。</p> <p>业务中使用网路请求，3 中代理模式完全一致。</p> <h2 id=->多域的使用</h2> <p>上面讲述中，我们例举了一个域的使用，gem-mine 支持多域的配置，我们在<code>config/proxy.js</code>增加一个域：</p> <pre><code class=\\\"hljs javascript\\\">const config = {\\n  api: {\\n    <span class=hljs-keyword>mode</span>: <span class=hljs-string>'nginx'</span>,\\n    default<span class=hljs-variable>s:</span> {\\n      // 没有找到 env 时候的默认配置\\n      ur<span

  // WDS 使用的配置\\n      ur<span class=hljs-variable>l:</span> <span class=hljs-string>'http://local.cors.me'</span>,\\n      prefix: <span class=hljs-string>'/v2.0'</span>\\n    },\\n    debu<span class=hljs-variable>g:</span> {\\n      ur<span class=hljs-variable>l:</span> <span class=hljs-string>'http://debug.cors.me'</span>,\\n      prefix: <span class=hljs-string>'/proxy/v1.0'</span>\\n    }\\n  },\\n\\n  douban: {\\n    <span class=hljs-keyword>mode</span>: <span class=hljs-string>'server'</span>,\\n    default<span class=hljs-variable>s:</span> {\\n      // 没有找到 env 时候的默认配置\\n      ur<span class=hljs-variable>l:</span> <span class=hljs-string>'http://api.douban.com'</span>,\\n      prefix: <span class=hljs-string>'/v2'</span>\\n    },\\n    wd<span class=hljs-variable>s:</span>

}\\n}\\n\\nmodule.exports = config\\n</code></pre> <p>上面配置中，api 这个请求使用了 nginx 反向代理，douban 这个请求使用了 server 代理</p> <h2 id=->请求的切面处理</h2> <p>通常有以下这些需求：</p> <ul> <li>每次请求的头信息中需要携带计算的授权头</li> <li>大部分请求希望有统一的异常处理，无须每个请求都对异常进行处理</li> <li>请求如果超过一定时间，希望有统一的等待提示</li> </ul> <p>上面的需求可以通过请求的切面来实现，这些切面的配置文件位于：<code>src/global/request.js</code>，其代码大致结构如下：</p> <pre><code class=\\\"hljs javascript\\\"><span class=hljs-keyword>import</span> { request, actions } <span class=hljs-keyword>from</span> <span class=hljs-string>'cat-eye'</span>\\n<span class=hljs-keyword>import</span> proxyConfig <span class=hljs-keyword>from</span> <span class=hljs-string>'config/proxy'</span>\\n<span class=hljs-keyword>import</span> { getCurrentProxyConfig } <span class=hljs-keyword>from</span> <span class=hljs-string>'./util/proxy'</span>\\n\\nrequest.init(getCurrentProxyConfig(proxyConfig))\\n\\n<span class=hljs-comment>// 全局设置，对所有请求生效</span>\\nrequest.config({})\\n\\n<span class=hljs-comment>// 某个域的设置，对该域的请求生效</span>\\nrequest.api.config({})\\n</code></pre> <p>设置通常包括了以下几点：</p> <ul> <li>请求前的切面处理（before）</li> <li>loading 处理</li> <li>请求异常处理（error）</li> <li>请求完成处理（complete）</li> </ul> <p>例如对全局的设置：</p> <pre><code class=\\\"hljs javascript\\\">request.config({\\n  <span class=hljs-comment>// 当请求时间超过默认设定的1500ms时触发 loading</span>\\n  loading: <span class=hljs-function><span class=hljs-keyword>function</span><span class=hljs-params>(params)</span> </span>{\\n    <span class=hljs-comment>// this 指向这个请求实例，为了便于后面取消这个提示。这里使用了 fish 的 message 组件</span>\\n    <span class=hljs-keyword>this</span>.hideTip = message.loading(<span class=hljs-string>'请求仍在进行，请稍候...'</span>, <span class=hljs-number>15</span>)\\n  },\\n  <span class=hljs-comment>// 请求异常时的处理函数，这里使用 fish 的 message 组件进行提示</span>\\n  error: <span class=hljs-function><span class=hljs-keyword>function</span><span class=hljs-params>(res)</span> </span>{\\n    <span class=hljs-keyword>const</span> msg = getIn(res, <span class=hljs-string>'data.message'</span>) || <span class=hljs-string>'您的请求遇到了错误，请稍候再试'</span>\\n    message.error(msg, <span class=hljs-number>5</span>)\\n  },\\n  <span class=hljs-comment>// 请求完成时的处理函数，无论成功失败，这里只是将 loading 隐藏</span>\\n  complete: <span class=hljs-function><span class=hljs-keyword>function</span><span class=hljs-params>(res)</span> </span>{\\n    <span class=hljs-keyword>if</span> (<span class=hljs-keyword>this</span>.hideTip) {\\n      <span class=hljs-keyword>this</span>.hideTip()\\n    }\\n  }\\n})\\n</code></pre> <p>还可以对某个域进行设置，如果有重复的切面，则域的设置会覆盖全局的设置：</p> <pre><code class=\\\"hljs javascript\\\"><span class=hljs-selector-tag>request</span><span class=hljs-selector-class>.api</span><span class=hljs-selector-class>.config</span>({\\n  <span class=hljs-attribute>error</span>: <span class=hljs-built_in>function</span>(res) {\\n    <span class=hljs-built_in>alert</span>(res.data.message)\\n  }\\n})\\n</code></pre> <p>因此 api 请求还会使用 全局的 loading 和 complete，但是 error 使用自己定义的方式。</p> <p>对于统一授权头的处理，是通过 before 切面进行设定：</p> <pre><code class=\\\"hljs javascript\\\">request<span class=hljs-selector-class>.api</span><span class=hljs-selector-class>.config</span>({\\n  <span class=hljs-comment>// params: axios 的请求配置参数</span>\\n  <span class=hljs-comment>// ins: 请求实例</span>\\n  <span class=hljs-comment>// cfg: 对应的 proxy 的配置（即 config/proxy.js 中对应环境下的配置），如果有配置额外的参数，这里就可以拿到</span>\\n  before: function(params, <span class=hljs-selector-tag>ins</span>, cfg) {\\n    return setIn(params, {\\n      <span class=hljs-string>'headers.Authorization'</span>: <span class=hljs-string>'...'</span>\\n    })\\n

id=-sub-module->嵌套路由：sub 和 module 的区别</h4> <p>sub 和 module 都属于嵌套路由，会从祖先路由那里继承到 path 和 permission。其区别在于 sub 是子路由，需要一个容器作为承载，路由变化时，只有指定部分的内容会发生变化。 module 我们称之为平级模块，只是为了较少 path 和 permission 书写而已。module 无论嵌套多少级他们之间都是平级的，是共享操作一个区域的内容。</p> <p>子路由 sub 被 <code>&lt;Routes&gt;</code> 组件接收，是这样使用的：</p> <pre><code class=\\\"hljs javascript\\\"><span class=hljs-comment>// 使用顶级路由</span>\\n<span class=hljs-params>&lt;Routes/&gt;</span>\\n\\n<span class=hljs-comment>// 使用某个子路由</span>\\n<span class=hljs-params>&lt;Routes path=\\\"main.admin\\\"/&gt;</span>\\n</code></pre> <h4 id=->默认路由</h4> <p>默认路由是针对 sub 的，当给某个 sub 的元素指定 index:true 时，如果 url 对应的是父路由的 path，该子路由会作为默认显示。例如上面的配置，当访问 / 时，permission 通过时，由于其 home 子路由具有 index:true，因此会默认显示 home 对应的内容。当然，访问 /home 也是一样显示 home。</p> <p>默认路由还有另外一种写法，即子路由的 path 为 / 时，就是作为默认子路由显示，此时通常需要增加一个 exact:true 防止路由冲突，例如上面配置中的 main.admin.log.list。</p> <p>如果是 module，想默认进入某个路由，可以使用 redirect 进行跳转。</p> <h4 id=->路由的拆分</h4> <p>所有路由都写在 <code>src/global/routes/index.js</code> 下的话，可能会导致该文件变得很大，多人协作时容易引起冲突。可以利用 js 的模块性质进行拆分，通常根据功能块进行拆分：</p> <pre><code class=\\\"hljs javascript\\\"><span class=hljs-string>import</span> <span

actions.routing 上的这些方法，在更新 location 的同时，你的 routing 与 Redux store 将会保持同步，同时一个 type 为 <code>@@router/LOCATION_CHANGE</code> 的 action 会被 dispatch。</p> <p>例如，我们需要代码中 3 秒后跳转到一个新的 url：</p> <pre><code

id=->规划模块与路由</h3> <p>模块分为：</p> <ul> <li>首页</li> <li>文档</li> </ul> <p>它们共有头部和底部，头部导航去各个文档的分类，底部则是一些链接地址。</p> <p>因此路由就按此来划分，由于首页仅一个页面，就放在 <code>src/global/routes/index.js</code> 中配置，文档涉及了很多页面，独立拆分出 <code>src/global/routes/docs.js</code> 来配置。我们并不急于如何编写这个文件如何，可以新建出这个路由文件，以及在 components 下建立 <code>home</code> 和 <code>docs</code> 两个目录，作为后续开发的基础。那现在的增加的目录结构为（不变的省略）：</p> <pre><code class=\\\"hljs

<p>经过一些选型比较（依据：兼容性、易用性、维护性），动画库选择 <a href=https://github.com/google-fabric/velocity-react target=_blank>velocity-react@1.2.2</a>：</p> <pre><code class=\\\"hljs shell\\\"><span

class=hljs-keyword>2</span> --save\\n</code></pre> <p>velocity-react 在 IE8 下的动画需要依赖 jquery，因此引进 jquery-1.9.0（最后支持 IE8 的版本），引入工作需要进行以下三步：</p> <ul> <li>下载 jquery-1.9.0（压缩后的版本），放入 public 目录</li> <li>修改 <code>config/webpack.js</code>，将 jquery-1.9.0.js 加入到 additional 数组中，这样 webpack 编译时就会将其拷贝到目标目录中</li> <li>修改 <code>public/index.html</code>，使用 IE 条件表达式，用 script 标签引入 jquery</li> </ul> <p>然后重新 npm start 启动项目（修改了 webpack 的配置需要重新启动才能生效）</p> <p>此时，home 目录为：</p> <pre><code class=\\\"hljs text\\\">├── src\\n│     ├── components\\n│     │     ├── home\\n│     │     │     ├── index<span

Console、Info、Logo 三个子组件。Console 组件用到了打字效果，同样经过选型比较，选择了 <code>react-typist</code>。但其不兼容 IE8，此时有几种解决方案：</p> <ol> <li>简单粗暴：使用其源码，将其放入 src，利用脚手架可以处理 IE8 的能力</li> <li>fork 该项目，修改源码，使其源码兼容 IE8，然后 npm 通过 github 来安装</li> <li>修改脚手架，对该包特殊处理</li> </ol> <p>常规的做法是第 2 种，但这里采用了第一种（因为这个 lib 功能比较简单，基本没有后续维护的需求），将其放在了 <code>src/components/common/typist</code>。</p> <p>编写完代码后，修改 <code>src/global/routes/index.js</code>，添加 home 对应的路由，然后浏览器中就能看到酷炫的首页了。</p> <h3 id=->文档开发</h3> <p>为了解析 markdown 文件并将其转化为 jsx，借助了 <code>marked</code> 这个库，同时为了显示代码语法高亮，结合了 <code>highlight.js</code>。这里自定义了一个 webpack 的 loader 来处理 <code>config/webpack/loaders/markdown.js</code>，同时将该 loader 加入 <code>config/webpack.js</code> 的 loaders 字段。同样由于修改了 webpack 配置，需要重新 npm start --hot 启动。</p> <p>解析来就是在 src/components/docs 目录下撸 markdown 文档了。文档具有二级目录，因此使用了子路由功能，鉴于各个文档结构布局的一致性，这里用了一些小技巧，提供了 Layout.jsx 进行封装。</p> <pre><code class=\\\"hljs text\\\">├── src\\n│     ├── components\\n│     │     ├── docs\\n│     │     │     ├── api\\n│     │     │     │     ├── <span class=hljs-keyword>markdown </span>files\\n│     │     │     ├── guide\\n│     │     │     │     ├──

<p>然后处理路由，配置对应文档的地址，<code>src/global/routes/docs.js</code> 看起来和常规路由配置有些不同，只是利用了 <code>src/global/routes/docs-helper.js</code> 提供的函数对 markdown 和 Layout 进行统一处理少写点重复的代码，仅此而已。</p> <h3 id=->收获</h3> <p>使用

等版本都会进行处理</strong></li> <li>支持选择内置 UI 组件库</li> <li>支持快速生成管理后台结构</li> </ul> </li> <li><p>基于 cat-eye 猫眼，提供了一套优质的代码框架与工具</p> <ul> <li>简洁易用的 model 系统，大大降低 redux 的繁琐与复杂度</li> <li>抽象封装的 router 系统，基于 react-router 4，支持子路由、权限控制与继承</li> <li>轻量高效的 immutable 工具，简化对 state 的操作，同时提高性能</li> <li>强大简单的网络请求 request 工具，基于 axios<ul> <li>支持多种方式处理跨域问题（server 代理、nginx 反向代理、CORS 跨域）</li> <li>支持多站点跨域</li> <li>可以根据不同环境变量进行统一配置</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li><p>国际化方案（暂未支持）</p> <ul> <li>业务国际化</li> <li>UI 组件库国际化</li> <li>工具类国际化（moment 定制）</li> <li>支持远程翻译资源文件</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2 id=->与社区脚手架的差异</h2> <p><a href=https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app target=_blank>create-react-app</a> 是 facebook 官方的脚手架，具有简单、易上手、易调试的特点，通过底层提供的 react-scripts 屏蔽了 webpack 配置的复杂度，对于纯粹学习使用 react 来说是一个很好的选择。但如果需要进行一些自定义，则需要进行 eject，create-react-app 会将 webpack 配置重新暴露出来。同时，create-react-app 提供的功能都比较基础纯粹，并不提供 redux、router 等工具的结合使用，也没有整合 less、sass、css 模块化，需要开发者自己进行处理。</p> <p><a href=https://github.com/dvajs/dva target=_blank>dva</a> 是阿里提供的一个脚手架。通过 <a href=https://github.com/sorrycc/roadhog target=_blank>roadhog</a> 提供了可配置性 create-react-app 开发体验。dva 提供了对 redux 的封装，享受 redux 带来管理数据的便利性的同时降低了使用的繁琐。同时集成了 redux-saga、react-router-redux、react-router，很大程度上给开发带来了便利。</p> <p>gem-mine 吸收了社区中优质脚手架的优点，同时做了部分增强和改进工作，例如：</p> <ul> <li>model 层设计吸收了更简洁的 <a href=https://github.com/mirrorjs/mirror target=_blank>mirror</a> 设计，并内置加入了一个轻量的 immutable 工具，提供了类似 react 的 this.setState 简便操作 state 工具 this.setField 来操作 redux 的 state，而没有官方提供的 immutable 带来的语法和使用成本。</li> <li>再有，在 路由 层面做了增强，对 react-router 做了兼容 IE8 的基础上，同时提供了一套配置性的路由管理工具，支持路由的嵌套、继承、权限控制等。</li> <li>以及，网络请求工具的封装、国际化方案的支持、可选的内置 UI 组件库 等等，都是致力于降低开发人员上手的难度，专注于业务开发，提供生产力。</li> </ul> <p>最后，兼容 IE8 是脚手架的一个另类的特性，是的，真的很另类。</p> \";\n\n/***/ }),\n/* 152 */\n/***/ (function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = __webpack_require__.p +

Wraps a single child without adding\nadditional DOM nodes.\n\nThe API attempts to be as declarative as possible. A single animation property declares what\nanimation the child should have. If that property changes, this component applies the new animation\nto the child on the next tick.\n\nBy default, the animation is not run when the component is mounted. Instead, Velocity's \"finish\"\ncommand is used to jump to the animation's end state. For a component that animates out of and\nback in to a default state, this allows the parent to specify the \"animate into\" animation as\nthe default, and therefore not have to distinguish between the initial state and the state to\nreturn to after animating away.\n\nProperties:\n animation: Either an animation key or hash defining the animation. See Velocity's documentation\n   for what this can be. (It is passed to Velocity exactly.)\n runOnMount: If true, runs the animation even when the component is first mounted.\n targetQuerySelector: By default, this component's single child is animated. If targetQuerySelector\n   is provided, it is used to select descendants to apply the animation to. Use with caution, only\n   when you're confident that React's reconciliation will preserve these nodes during animation.\n   Also note querySelectorAll's silly behavior w.r.t. pruning results when being called on a node.\n   A special value of \"children\" will use the direct children of the node, since there isn't a\n   great way to specify that to querySelectorAll.\n interruptBehavior: Sets how the previous animation should behave when the \"animation\" prop is\n   changed before it’s done. Default is \"stop\", which halts the animation where it is. \"finish\"\n   will jump the animation to its completed appearance. \"queue\" will run the new animation after\n   the previous one has finished.\n\nUnrecognized properties are passed as options to Velocity (e.g. \"duration\", \"delay\", \"loop\").\n\nMethods:\n runAnimation: Triggers the animation immediately. Useful for when you want an animation that\n   corresponds to an event but not a particular model state change (e.g. a \"bump\" when a click\n   occurs).\n*/\n\nvar _ = {\n  forEach: require('lodash/collection/forEach'),\n  isEqual: require('lodash/lang/isEqual'),\n  keys: require('lodash/object/keys'),\n  omit: require('lodash/object/omit')\n};\nvar React = require('react');\nvar ReactDOM = require('react-dom');\nvar Velocity = require('./lib/velocity-animate-shim');\n\nvar VelocityComponent = React.createClass({\n  displayName: 'VelocityComponent',\n\n  propTypes: {\n    animation: React.PropTypes.any,\n    children: React.PropTypes.element.isRequired,\n    runOnMount: React.PropTypes.bool,\n    targetQuerySelector: React.PropTypes.string,\n    interruptBehavior: React.PropTypes.string\n    // Any additional properties will be sent as options to Velocity\n  },\n\n  getDefaultProps: function () {\n    return {\n      animation: null,\n      runOnMount: false,\n      targetQuerySelector: null,\n      interruptBehavior: 'stop'\n    }\n  },\n\n  componentDidMount: function () {\n    this.runAnimation();\n\n    // Jump to the end so that the component has the visual appearance of the animation having\n    // been run to completion.\n    if (this.props.runOnMount !== true) {\n      this._finishAnimation();\n    }\n  },\n\n  componentWillUpdate: function (newProps, newState) {\n    if (!_.isEqual(newProps.animation, this.props.animation)) {\n      if (newProps.interruptBehavior === 'stop') {\n        this._stopAnimation();\n      } else if (newProps.interruptBehavior === 'finish') {\n        this._finishAnimation();\n      }\n\n      this._scheduleAnimation();\n    }\n  },\n\n  componentWillUnmount: function () {\n    this._stopAnimation();\n    this._clearVelocityCache(this._getDOMTarget());\n  },\n\n  // It's ok to call this externally!

Use this for non-animating properties (like \"position\") that\nare prerequisites for correct animation. The style value is applied using Velocity's JS -> CSS\nroutines, which may differ from React's.\n\nAny hash entries beyond \"animation\" and \"style\" are passed in an options hash to Velocity. Use this\nfor options like \"stagger\", \"reverse\", &tc.\n\nBy default, this component will immediately hide all entering children with display: 'none', and\nunhide them one tick later with display: ''. This is done so that we can coalesce multiple enters\ninto a single animation, and we want to avoid any popping of elements in while they're collected.

Instead, this\n    component will behave like a vanilla TransitionGroup.\n\nInspired by https://gist.github.com/tkafka/0d94c6ec94297bb67091\n*/\n\nvar _ = {\n  each: require('lodash/collection/each'),\n  extend: require('lodash/object/extend'),\n  forEach: require('lodash/collection/forEach'),\n  isEqual: require('lodash/lang/isEqual'),\n  keys: require('lodash/object/keys'),\n  omit: require('lodash/object/omit'),\n  pluck: require('lodash/collection/pluck')\n};\nvar React = require('react');\nvar ReactDOM = require('react-dom');\nvar ReactTransitionGroup = require('react-addons-transition-group');\nvar Velocity = require('./lib/velocity-animate-shim');\n\n// Shim requestAnimationFrame for browsers that don't support it, in particular IE 9.\nvar shimRequestAnimationFrame =\n  (typeof window !== 'undefined') && (\n    window.requestAnimationFrame ||\n    window.webkitRequestAnimationFrame ||\n    window.mozRequestAnimationFrame ||\n    function(callback) { window.setTimeout(callback, 0) }\n  );\n\n// Fix 'Invalid calling object' error in IE\nshimRequestAnimationFrame = (typeof window !== 'undefined') &&  shimRequestAnimationFrame.bind(window);\n\n// Internal wrapper for the transitioned elements.

<li>effects：一般异步的操作（有副作用的操作，非纯函数）放在 effects，而不放在 reducers 中。对于业务来说，大部分操作都是异步请求，因此 effects 更经常使用。另外，effects 无须返回 state，通常我们会把异步操作返回，也就是返回一个 promise。除此之外，effects 看起来和 reducers 并没有什么两样，定义的方法同样会挂载到 actions 上。</li> </ul> <p>reducers、effects 更详细的用法后面也会介绍。</p> <h2 id=-model>使用 model</h2> <h3 id=model->model 的加载</h3> <p>model 是自动引入到系统的，但需要满足下面其中一个原则：</p> <ul> <li>全局的 model 放在

reducers、effects 后，这些方法就会挂载在 actions 下，可以直接拿来使用：</p> <pre><code class=\\\"hljs javascript\\\"><span class=hljs-keyword>import</span> { actions } <span class=hljs-keyword>from</span> <span class=hljs-string>'cat-eye'</span>\\n</code></pre> <p>如果不需要进行加工，可以在 JSX 中直接调用对应的方法：</p> <pre><code>&lt;SomeComponent onClick={actions<span class=hljs-selector-class>.user</span><span

<p>这样看起来和 connect 似乎并无差别，重点是 mapDispatchToProps 可以直接取到 this.props 的值作为参数，来看下 mapDispatchToProps 的使用：</p> <pre><code class=\\\"hljs javascript\\\"><span class=hljs-keyword>import</span> { actions } <span class=hljs-keyword>from</span> <span class=hljs-string>'cat-eye'</span>\\n<span class=hljs-comment>// mapDispatchToProps 的 props 即这个组件的 this.props</span>\\n<span class=hljs-keyword>export</span>

}\\n})(SomeComponent)\\n</code></pre> <p>而 mapStateToProps 和 connect 并无两异：</p> <pre><code>// mapStateToProps\\n(<span class=hljs-keyword>state</span>, ownProps) =&gt; {\\n  const s = <span class=hljs-keyword>state</span>.<span class=hljs-keyword>user</span>;\\n  return {\\n    // the fields you want <span class=hljs-keyword>to</span> map\\n  }\\n}\\n</code></pre><p>cat-eye 同样将 connect 暴露了出来，但推荐你使用 smart。</p> <h3 id=setfield>setField</h3> <p>setFiled 依赖于 <a href=https://github.com/gem-mine/zero-immutable target=_blank>zero-immutable</a> 的实现，将 immutable 的能力内置在 gem-mine

都会默认注册一个 setField 方法，这样 actions 上就会有该 model 的 setField 方法。正是由于这个方法的存在，导致了 reducers 存在感非常低，大部分设值操作都变得多余，直接通过 setField 进行即可。</p> <pre><code class=\\\"hljs javascript\\\">import { actions } <span class=hljs-keyword>from</span> 'cat-eye'\\n\\n// 在某个组件中直接修改 <span class=hljs-keyword>user</span> <span class=hljs-keyword>state</span>，无须定义 reducer\\nactions.<span class=hljs-keyword>user</span>.<span class=hljs-built_in>set</span>Field({\\n  name: 'tom',\\n  age: age =&gt; age + <span class=hljs-number>1</span>\\n})\\n</code></pre> <p>如果是纯粹的 redux 开发，这里要定义常量，定义 state，定义 action，实现 reducer，最后才在组件中进行 dispatch（可能还需要 connect），这里就简化成了一步。</p> <h4 id=-reducers->在 reducers 中使用</h4> <p><strong>重要：reducers 中定义的 function 请不要使用箭头函数，否则会丢失 this</strong></p> <p>reducers 的 function 是这样定义的：</p> <pre><code class=\\\"hljs javascript\\\">// <span class=hljs-keyword>user</span> model 的 reducers\\n\\n{\\n  // data 是 actions.<span class=hljs-keyword>user</span>.growUp(data) 传入的\\n  // getState 可以获取到 redux 的整个 <span class=hljs-keyword>state</span>\\n  growUp(data, getState) {\\n    // reducer 必须 return 一个新的 <span class=hljs-keyword>state</span>，<span class=hljs-built_in>set</span>Field 就有这个能力\\n    return this.<span class=hljs-built_in>set</span>Field({\\n      // ...\\n    })\\n  }\\n}\\n</code></pre> <p>可以看到，reducer 中的 this 具有 setField 方法，可以对自己的 model 的 state 进行更新。对于获取 state 的，分为：</p> <ul> <li>获取自己 model 的 state：通过 <code>this.getState()</code> 就可以拿到</li> <li>获取所有的 state：通过第二个参数 <code>getState()</code> 可以拿到，然后根据命名空间来获取，例如 getState().book.name</li> </ul> <h4 id=-effects->在 effects 中使用</h4> <p>effects 中的使用和 reducers 中完全一样，只是无须返回 state。同样，<strong>请不要使用箭头函数</strong>。一般在 effects 中会使用到 网络请求，这部分文档参看 <a href=#/docs/api/request>网络请求</a></p> <pre><code class=\\\"hljs

defaults，则所有环境下都使用同一个请求配置，无论本地、测试环境、预生产环境，还是生产环境。不同环境下通常会有不同的请求配置，例如我们针对本地和测试环境，添加配置：</p> <pre><code class=\\\"hljs javascript\\\"><span class=hljs-keyword>const</span> <span class=hljs-built_in>config</span> = {\\n  api: {\\n    mode: <span class=hljs-string>'cors'</span>, <span class=hljs-comment>// CORS 模式</span>\\n    defaults: {\\n      <span class=hljs-comment>//

WDS 使用的配置</span>\\n      url: <span class=hljs-string>'http://local.cors.me'</span>,\\n      prefix: <span class=hljs-string>'/v1.0'</span>\\n    },\\n    debug: {\\n      url: <span

class=hljs-built_in>config</span>\\n</code></pre> <p>对于某个请求服务，使用到的配置优先级查找顺序是这样的：</p> <ol> <li>提供了 env，则根据 env 查找配置，找到则直接得到配置</li> <li>没有提供 env，或者提供的 env 对应的配置不存在，分情况来看：<ul> <li>如果通过 webpack-dev-server 来启动，则先找 key 为 wds 的配置（例如上面 api 请求服务，如果通过 WDS 启动，没有找到配置情况下会先查找 api.wds）；如果 wds 配置也不存在，才会去找 defaults 配置。</li> <li>对于非本地情况，不可能以 WDS 启动，因此没有找到配置情况下，默认都是查找 defaults 配置。</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>注意，本地如果配置了 wds，不论 mode 使用什么，都将使用 webpack-dev-server 的 proxy 代理，本质是 server 代理（wepack-dev-server 内置了 express 服务器）。webpack-dev-server 的文档可以点击查阅：<a href=https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html target=_blank>webpack dev server</a>，我们做了一层封装，让 webpack-dev-server 的 proxy 更简单使用。</p> <p>因此你通过 chrome 开发者工具看到的网络请求如下：</p> <pre><code>http:<span class=hljs-regexp>//</span>localhost:<span class=hljs-number>9000</span><span class=hljs-regexp>/api_wds/</span>v1.<span class=hljs-number>0</span><span class=hljs-regexp>/mock?q=hello</span>\\n</code></pre><p>是请求的本地 webpack-dev-server 服务器，api_wds 是脚手架自动添加的前缀用来给 webpack-dev-server 识别这是代理请求，需要转发。最终转发到</p> <pre><code>http:<span class=hljs-regexp>//</span>cors.me<span class=hljs-regexp>/v1.0/m</span>ock?q=hello\\n</code></pre><p>这个 URL 上。</p> <p>当然，本地如果配置了 wds，但是想测试下其他配置，可以使用 env 方式：</p> <pre><code class=\\\"hljs bash\\\"><span class=hljs-comment># 使用 defaults 配置</span>\\nnpm <span class=hljs-built_in>start</span> <span class=hljs-comment>--env=defaults</span>\\n\\n<span class=hljs-comment># 使用 debug 配置</span>\\nnpm <span class=hljs-built_in>start</span> <span class=hljs-comment>--env=debug</span>\\n</code></pre> <h3 id=server->server 代理</h3> <p>server 代理需要在前端工程中加入后端代码，因此项目不会是纯静态项目。后端代码通常是用来做统一请求处理，将请求统一转发到对应的服务器，从而绕过跨域限制。这个弊端就是对后端有要求，极端情况下，对接不同语言的后端，要分别实现一遍代理请求处理。</p> <p><code>config/proxy.js</code> 其配置和上面 CORS 基本一致：</p> <pre><code class=\\\"hljs javascript\\\"><span class=hljs-keyword>const</span> <span class=hljs-built_in>config</span> = {\\n  api: {\\n    mode: <span class=hljs-string>'server'</span>, <span class=hljs-comment>// server 模式，不填默认也是 server</span>\\n    defaults: {\\n      <span class=hljs-comment>// 没有找到 env 时候的默认配置</span>\\n      url: <span class=hljs-string>'http://cors.me'</span>,\\n      prefix: <span class=hljs-string>'/proxy/v1.0'</span>\\n    },\\n    wds: {\\n      <span class=hljs-comment>// WDS 使用的配置</span>\\n      url: <span class=hljs-string>'http://local.cors.me'</span>,\\n      prefix: <span class=hljs-string>'/v2.0'</span>\\n    },\\n    debug: {\\n      url: <span class=hljs-string>'http://debug.cors.me'</span>,\\n      prefix: <span class=hljs-string>'/proxy/v1.0'</span>\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n\\n<span class=hljs-keyword>module</span>.exports = <span class=hljs-built_in>config</span>\\n</code></pre> <p>和 CORS 中配置的区别是，非 wds 模式下，prefix 添加了一个前缀 /proxy（defaults 和 debug 配置中可以看到）。这个前缀是为了让后端代码路由识别，统一处理。这个规则需要前后端进行协定。</p> <p>wds 和上一节 CORS 中介绍的一致，业务代码使用请求也和 CORS 完全一致，不在赘述。</p> <h3 id=nginx->nginx 反向代理</h3> <p>nginx 反向代理和 server 代理类似，是实现了同域请求转发功能，只是转发功能放到了 nginx 上来处理。前端工程通常就需要 nginx 支持，因此和 server 代理对比，就没有了服务端代码。</p> <p><code>config/proxy.js</code> 其配置和上面 server 代理，除了 mode 外完全一致：</p> <pre><code class=\\\"hljs javascript\\\">const config = {\\n  api: {\\n    <span class=hljs-keyword>mode</span>: <span class=hljs-string>'nginx'</span>,\\n    default<span class=hljs-variable>s:</span> {\\n      // 没有找到 env

prefix: <span class=hljs-string>'/proxy/v1.0'</span>\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nmodule.exports = config\\n</code></pre> <p>prefix 在非 wds 配置下，同样增加了 /proxy 前缀，是为了发送请求后被 nginx 识别，将需要的请求转发到服务器。</p> <p>业务中使用网路请求，3 中代理模式完全一致。</p> <h2 id=->多域的使用</h2> <p>上面讲述中，我们例举了一个域的使用，gem-mine 支持多域的配置，我们在<code>config/proxy.js</code>增加一个域：</p> <pre><code class=\\\"hljs javascript\\\">const config = {\\n  api:

}\\n}\\n\\nmodule.exports = config\\n</code></pre> <p>上面配置中，api 这个请求使用了 nginx 反向代理，douban 这个请求使用了 server 代理</p> <h2 id=->请求的切面处理</h2> <p>通常有以下这些需求：</p> <ul> <li>每次请求的头信息中需要携带计算的授权头</li> <li>大部分请求希望有统一的异常处理，无须每个请求都对异常进行处理</li> <li>请求如果超过一定时间，希望有统一的等待提示</li> </ul> <p>上面的需求可以通过请求的切面来实现，这些切面的配置文件位于：<code>src/global/request.js</code>，其代码大致结构如下：</p> <pre><code class=\\\"hljs

class=hljs-comment>// 某个域的设置，对该域的请求生效</span>\\nrequest.api.config({})\\n</code></pre> <p>设置通常包括了以下几点：</p> <ul> <li>请求前的切面处理（before）</li> <li>loading 处理</li> <li>请求异常处理（error）</li> <li>请求完成处理（complete）</li> </ul> <p>例如对全局的设置：</p> <pre><code class=\\\"hljs javascript\\\">request.config({\\n  <span class=hljs-comment>// 当请求时间超过默认设定的1500ms时触发 loading</span>\\n  loading: <span class=hljs-function><span class=hljs-keyword>function</span><span class=hljs-params>(params)</span> </span>{\\n    <span class=hljs-comment>// this 指向这个请求实例，为了便于后面取消这个提示。这里使用了 fish 的 message

}\\n})\\n</code></pre> <p>还可以对某个域进行设置，如果有重复的切面，则域的设置会覆盖全局的设置：</p> <pre><code class=\\\"hljs javascript\\\"><span class=hljs-selector-tag>request</span><span class=hljs-selector-class>.api</span><span class=hljs-selector-class>.config</span>({\\n  <span class=hljs-attribute>error</span>: <span class=hljs-built_in>function</span>(res) {\\n    <span class=hljs-built_in>alert</span>(res.data.message)\\n  }\\n})\\n</code></pre> <p>因此 api 请求还会使用 全局的 loading 和 complete，但是 error 使用自己定义的方式。</p> <p>对于统一授权头的处理，是通过 before 切面进行设定：</p> <pre><code class=\\\"hljs javascript\\\">request<span class=hljs-selector-class>.api</span><span class=hljs-selector-class>.config</span>({\\n  <span class=hljs-comment>// params: axios 的请求配置参数</span>\\n  <span

则渲染默认无权限组件，返回一个组件时是表示无权限对应的自定义组件。嵌套的路由会继承祖先的 permission 权限拦截函数，因此只有祖先 permission 返回 true 后才会进入目标路由</li> <li>description：描述，相当于一个注释作用</li> <li>index：是否作为默认子路由</li> <li>redirect：进入该路由后自动跳转到指定路由。<strong>注意：redirect 不能和 sub 同级别存在，也就是某一项路由中，redirect 和 sub 不能同时存在</strong>，因为如果 redirect 的目标是自己的子路由，而子路由渲染必然需要经过祖先路由，又会触发 redirect，从而死循环。虽然 redirect 一般是结合 module 使用，表示跳转进入某个平级路由，但 redirect 其实是可以跳转进入任意的其他路由。</li> <li>sub：子路由，其下配置也是一个路由配置</li> <li>module：平级模块路由，其下配置也是一个路由配置</li> <li>exact：唯一匹配，否则”/“和”/page1”都会匹配到 path 为&quot;/&quot;的路由，制定 exact

id=-sub-module->嵌套路由：sub 和 module 的区别</h4> <p>sub 和 module 都属于嵌套路由，会从祖先路由那里继承到 path 和 permission。其区别在于 sub 是子路由，需要一个容器作为承载，路由变化时，只有指定部分的内容会发生变化。 module 我们称之为平级模块，只是为了较少 path 和 permission 书写而已。module 无论嵌套多少级他们之间都是平级的，是共享操作一个区域的内容。</p> <p>子路由 sub 被 <code>&lt;Routes&gt;</code> 组件接收，是这样使用的：</p> <pre><code class=\\\"hljs javascript\\\"><span class=hljs-comment>// 使用顶级路由</span>\\n<span class=hljs-params>&lt;Routes/&gt;</span>\\n\\n<span class=hljs-comment>// 使用某个子路由</span>\\n<span class=hljs-params>&lt;Routes path=\\\"main.admin\\\"/&gt;</span>\\n</code></pre> <h4 id=->默认路由</h4> <p>默认路由是针对 sub 的，当给某个 sub 的元素指定 index:true 时，如果 url 对应的是父路由的 path，该子路由会作为默认显示。例如上面的配置，当访问 / 时，permission 通过时，由于其 home 子路由具有 index:true，因此会默认显示 home 对应的内容。当然，访问 /home 也是一样显示 home。</p> <p>默认路由还有另外一种写法，即子路由的 path 为 / 时，就是作为默认子路由显示，此时通常需要增加一个 exact:true 防止路由冲突，例如上面配置中的 main.admin.log.list。</p> <p>如果是 module，想默认进入某个路由，可以使用 redirect 进行跳转。</p> <h4 id=->路由的拆分</h4> <p>所有路由都写在 <code>src/global/routes/index.js</code> 下的话，可能会导致该文件变得很大，多人协作时容易引起冲突。可以利用 js 的模块性质进行拆分，通常根据功能块进行拆分：</p> <pre><code class=\\\"hljs javascript\\\"><span class=hljs-string>import</span> <span

参数</h4> <p>获取查询参数通过 cat-eye 提供的 <code>queryString</code> 工具对 search 参数进行解析，获取路径参数直接通过 props.match.params 来获取。</p> <p>例如上面路由中定义的 main.topic.detail 对应的 url：/topics/233?name=tom&amp;age22，其中的 233 就是路径参数（key 为 id），name 和 age 是查询参数，可以这样获取：</p> <pre><code class=\\\"hljs javascript\\\"><span class=hljs-keyword>import</span> { queryString } from <span class=hljs-string>'cat-eye'</span>\\n\\n<span

对组件进行包装。</p> <h4 id=js->js 中路由跳转</h4> <p>actions 中默认具有一个 routing 对象，这个对象上有 5 个方法，是用来更新 location 的：</p> <ul> <li>push(url)： 往 history 中添加一条记录，并跳转到目标 url（浏览器具有后退功能）</li> <li>replace(url)： 替换 hisotry 中当前 url（替换当前 url，不会加入浏览器历史栈）</li> <li>go()：往前或者往后跳转</li> <li>goForward()：往前跳转一条历史记录，等价于 go(1)。</li> <li>goBack()：往后跳转一条历史记录，等价于 go(-1)。</li> </ul> <p>这些方法来自于 history API，意义和用法完全一致。不过与原生方法不同的是，调用 actions.routing 上的这些方法，在更新 location 的同时，你的 routing 与 Redux store 将会保持同步，同时一个 type 为 <code>@@router/LOCATION_CHANGE</code> 的 action 会被 dispatch。</p> <p>例如，我们需要代码中 3 秒后跳转到一个新的 url：</p> <pre><code

<code>config/webpack.js</code>，将 jquery-1.9.0.js 加入到 additional 数组中，这样 webpack 编译时就会将其拷贝到目标目录中</li> <li>修改 <code>public/index.html</code>，使用 IE 条件表达式，用 script 标签引入 jquery</li> </ul> <p>然后重新 npm start 启动项目（修改了 webpack 的配置需要重新启动才能生效）</p> <p>此时，home 目录为：</p> <pre><code class=\\\"hljs text\\\">├── src\\n│     ├── components\\n│     │     ├── home\\n│     │     │     ├── index<span class=hljs-selector-class>.jsx</span>\\n│     │     │     ├── model<span class=hljs-selector-class>.js</span>\\n│     │     │     ├── style.scss\\n</code></pre> <p>这种标准结构，后续可以考虑加入命令行功能来生成。开发过程中，又拆分出 Console、Info、Logo 三个子组件。Console 组件用到了打字效果，同样经过选型比较，选择了 <code>react-typist</code>。但其不兼容 IE8，此时有几种解决方案：</p> <ol> <li>简单粗暴：使用其源码，将其放入 src，利用脚手架可以处理 IE8 的能力</li> <li>fork 该项目，修改源码，使其源码兼容 IE8，然后 npm 通过 github 来安装</li> <li>修改脚手架，对该包特殊处理</li> </ol> <p>常规的做法是第 2 种，但这里采用了第一种（因为这个 lib 功能比较简单，基本没有后续维护的需求），将其放在了 <code>src/components/common/typist</code>。</p> <p>编写完代码后，修改 <code>src/global/routes/index.js</code>，添加 home 对应的路由，然后浏览器中就能看到酷炫的首页了。</p> <h3 id=->文档开发</h3> <p>为了解析 markdown 文件并将其转化为 jsx，借助了 <code>marked</code> 这个库，同时为了显示代码语法高亮，结合了 <code>highlight.js</code>。这里自定义了一个 webpack 的 loader 来处理 <code>config/webpack/loaders/markdown.js</code>，同时将该 loader 加入 <code>config/webpack.js</code> 的 loaders 字段。同样由于修改了 webpack 配置，需要重新 npm start --hot 启动。</p> <p>解析来就是在 src/components/docs 目录下撸 markdown 文档了。文档具有二级目录，因此使用了子路由功能，鉴于各个文档结构布局的一致性，这里用了一些小技巧，提供了 Layout.jsx 进行封装。</p> <pre><code class=\\\"hljs text\\\">├── src\\n│     ├── components\\n│     │     ├── docs\\n│     │     │     ├── api\\n│     │     │     │     ├── <span class=hljs-keyword>markdown </span>files\\n│     │     │     ├── guide\\n│     │     │     │     ├──

<p>然后处理路由，配置对应文档的地址，<code>src/global/routes/docs.js</code> 看起来和常规路由配置有些不同，只是利用了 <code>src/global/routes/docs-helper.js</code> 提供的函数对 markdown 和 Layout 进行统一处理少写点重复的代码，仅此而已。</p> <h3 id=->收获</h3> <p>使用

target=_blank>create-react-app</a> 是 facebook 官方的脚手架，具有简单、易上手、易调试的特点，通过底层提供的 react-scripts 屏蔽了 webpack 配置的复杂度，对于纯粹学习使用 react 来说是一个很好的选择。但如果需要进行一些自定义，则需要进行 eject，create-react-app 会将 webpack 配置重新暴露出来。同时，create-react-app 提供的功能都比较基础纯粹，并不提供 redux、router 等工具的结合使用，也没有整合 less、sass、css 模块化，需要开发者自己进行处理。</p> <p><a href=https://github.com/dvajs/dva target=_blank>dva</a> 是阿里提供的一个脚手架。通过 <a href=https://github.com/sorrycc/roadhog target=_blank>roadhog</a> 提供了可配置性 create-react-app 开发体验。dva 提供了对 redux 的封装，享受 redux 带来管理数据的便利性的同时降低了使用的繁琐。同时集成了 redux-saga、react-router-redux、react-router，很大程度上给开发带来了便利。</p> <p>gem-mine 吸收了社区中优质脚手架的优点，同时做了部分增强和改进工作，例如：</p> <ul> <li>model 层设计吸收了更简洁的 <a href=https://github.com/mirrorjs/mirror target=_blank>mirror</a> 设计，并内置加入了一个轻量的 immutable 工具，提供了类似 react 的 this.setState 简便操作 state 工具 this.setField 来操作 redux 的 state，而没有官方提供的 immutable 带来的语法和使用成本。</li> <li>再有，在 路由 层面做了增强，对 react-router 做了兼容 IE8 的基础上，同时提供了一套配置性的路由管理工具，支持路由的嵌套、继承、权限控制等。</li> <li>以及，网络请求工具的封装、国际化方案的支持、可选的内置 UI 组件库 等等，都是致力于降低开发人员上手的难度，专注于业务开发，提供生产力。</li> </ul> <p>最后，兼容 IE8 是脚手架的一个另类的特性，是的，真的很另类。</p>
